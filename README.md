# Eyes Lips Segmentation using DeepLabv3 and UNet

PyTorch code for binary segmentation on the [CelebAMask-HQ]() dataset in an intuitive and well-documented Jupyter Notebook you can follow along as a tutorial. We train two models - a UNet architecture from scratch and a pretrained DeepLabv3 with a ResNet50 backbone.

## Preparing the data

Run the script `make_masks.py` after downloading and unzipping the CelebAMask-HQ dataset to generate eyes and lips segmented masks. Or just obtain the pre-made masks from [here]().

## UNet

- Annoted architecture :

- Notebook :
- Pretrained weights after running 20 epochs on 1000 samples :

## DeepLabv3

- Notebook :
- Pretrained weights after running 15 epochs on 30000 samples :
